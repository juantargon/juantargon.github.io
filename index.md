# Data Engineer | Data Science | ML Engineer

I am a Data Engineer with experience in data ingestion, modeling, and processing across Big Data and Cloud environments.  
I previously worked at Santander Tecnología (via Datalytics) and Disbyte, where I designed large-scale pipelines, optimized ETL/ELT processes, and ensured data quality, performance, and consistency.  

I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Economics, Finance, and Computation (UNIA), focusing on Big Data, AI, and applied analytics.
